# Secondary findings are genetic test results that provide information about variants in a gene unrelated to the primary purpose for the testing, most often discovered when [Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome_sequencing) or [Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) is performed. This extension should be used to denote when a genetic finding is being shared as a secondary finding, and ideally refer to a corresponding guideline or policy statement.
